# Bored Game engine

A simple game engine designed to build board games. Started as a learning project and should remain as is in the future.

## Documentations

Well, still new and have not finished the 0.0 version, so focusing on building.
Also, does not have an editor YET, so the development process is a bit tidious. Just saying.

## Installation

Download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), latest version is recommended.
